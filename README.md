# Validation Nested - Employee Management System

## Project Overview
This Spring Boot project, titled 'Validation Nested', is designed to manage employee data with nested object validation. It showcases form validation in Spring MVC using Thymeleaf templates and integrates a MySQL database for persistence.

## Key Features
- **Nested Object Validation**: Implements validation for nested objects within an entity using Jakarta Bean Validation (formerly Java Bean Validation).
- **Thymeleaf Integration**: Utilizes Thymeleaf for server-side rendering of HTML forms and error messages.
- **CRUD Operations**: Supports Create and Read operations for employee entities, including their associated address details.
- **Form Error Handling**: Displays form validation errors on the front end using Thymeleaf's conditional rendering.

## Java and Spring Boot Features
- **Spring MVC**: Uses Model-View-Controller architecture for handling web requests.
- **Jakarta Persistence API (JPA)**: Manages relational data in Java applications using Hibernate as the provider.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Simplifies data access layer implementation with JPA.
- **MySQL Database**: Utilizes MySQL for data storage and retrieval.
- **Spring Boot Autoconfiguration**: Simplifies the setup and configuration of Spring applications.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure MySQL is installed and running.
3. Update the `application.properties` file with your database credentials.
4. Run `ValidationNestedApplication` to start the application.
5. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:8080/employee` for creating new employees.
